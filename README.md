# Mother Tree Crafts
Hello any intrepid visitor, and welcome to Mother Tree Crafts!
<br><br>
This repo is for what will be a 3-D print as well as other handicraft store for a client who currently doesn't have a main way to show the work they have done, so I am making this to help get them some better coverage on their work.
<br><br>
Granted for this intial iteration the webpage will act as a gallery to highlight the pieces they have already done as well as currently being worked on then will hopefully expand into an e-commerce webpage allowing for more robust features to be implemented.

## Features
Speaking of features, here is what will be implemnted for the inital webpage:
- The ability to make a secure account to favorite completed works as well as request specific commisions with the owners directly.
- A home page that will show off completed and work in progress items that are actively for sale (on other sites for this iteration).
- Items having indivial pages with multiple images showing off the item, the price point of each item, a description for each item as well as care instructions and a review function to allow for the sharing of both the good points of each item and the points that will need to be worked on

## Instructions 
*This section will be adjusted for when the site is in a more stable state to allow for offline viewing or viewing on a personal device*

## Screenshots
*This section will be updated as the webpage gets closer to it's first complete iteration as currently we have no pictures to show how the final design will look*

## Technologies Used
- ASP.NET Core MVC using C#
- Entity Framework Core
- Bootstrap 5
- HTML/CSS/JS
- More to be added!
